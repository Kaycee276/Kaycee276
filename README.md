# Hi there, I'm Izuaba Kenneth Kelechukwu! 👋

I design interfaces that move with purpose - React ecosystems built in TypeScript, where every animation serves a function and every component balances beauty with performance.
    The backend architecture is lean yet powerful: Node.js services with clean APIs, optimized queries, and secure authentication flows. When working with Web3, I focus on making blockchain interactions feel inevitable rather than intimidating - wallet connections that flow naturally, transaction visualizations that tell stories, and smart contracts that extend the UI's logic. Across the stack, I prioritize solutions that are maintainable first, then magical.
    The result is technology that feels personal yet professional, whether you're scrolling through a feed or signing a blockchain transaction
